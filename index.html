Starc garnered a lot of praise for prioritizing international duties over franchise-based T20 cricket. 2015 continued to be his golden year in terms of numbers as well as fitness, as he broke the 160km/h barrier against New Zealand at WACA Test in November 2015. He picked up the highest number of international wickets in the 2015 calendar year as well (87) and continued his upward climb, establishing himself as an indispensable asset for Australian cricket.</p>
